          I'm Rupanshi, an Indian with a passion for Drawing that began at
          the age of 3. Over the past four years, my work has evolved into a
          deeply personal exploration of my life, thoughts, and experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg text-muted">
          My Art has become my personal diary... what I can't express in
          words, I Paint! I primarily work with oil paints, pencils and
          pens, using these mediums to convey emotions, narratives, and
          reflections that are so important in my journey of Art and life.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg text-muted mb-0">
          My Art is not just a creative expression but a visual
          documentation of my perspective, shaped by years of dedication and
          artistic growth. Besides, I'm a choreographer and a performer.
